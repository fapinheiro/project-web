## CSS Insights
line-height for vertical alignment

pixels only for little things like shadows, borders etc. (because pixels overrides user’s browsers preferences)

font-size: use rem (relative to font-size of the root element)

width: % in combination with a max-width, ch (1 character width of “0” zero)

height: question urself "do i rly need to set height" if yes -> use a min-height in vh (Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport, the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.)

padding/margin: rem or em (reletive to font-size of the element), often use em for padding of buttons

media queries: em (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)
